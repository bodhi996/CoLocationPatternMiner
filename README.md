# CoLocationPatternMiner

## Domain 

Prior to understanding Spatial data mining, we must first delve into what exactly is data mining. Analysing large quantity of data to hunt for patterns is impractical for humans to engage in because it will be very time inefficient and prone to human error. Data mining is the process of sorting through large data sets to identify patterns and relationships that can help solve business problems through data analysis in a time efficient manner. Data mining techniques and tools enable enterprises to make sense of the data and extrapolate it into the future. One of the biggest implementation of data mining was first made by Walmart. Walmart uses data mining to analyze patterns in the sales data. Data mining helps Walmart find patterns that can be used to provide product recommendations to users based on which products
were bought together or which products were bought before the purchase of a particular product. Effective data mining at Walmart has increased its
conversion rate of customers. A familiar example of effective data mining through association rule learning technique at Walmart is ‚Äì finding that
Strawberry pop-tarts sales increased by 7 times before a Hurricane. After Walmart identified this association between Hurricane and Strawberry poptarts through data mining, it places all the Strawberry pop-tarts at the checkouts before a hurricane.  

## Idea

The idea of the project is as an intra-organizational employment-oriented service that operates via mobile apps. 
The organisation that we have used as a test case is BIT Mesra, however, it can be oriented towards any other organisation as well. The main goal is to bring convenience to freelancers and startups by hiring people from within the community from where they are based.<br />
The app can be handy to foster the experience of networking to those who have no prior industry experience and also to those looking for a cost competitive employability from within their organizational structure. 

# Achievements

Our application boasts of several features:
1. The application differentiates between verified and non-verified users. The algorithm will give verification symbols to those who have been consistent users of this platform.
2. The app also uses third party features such as Linkedin to give out users better depth into their prospective employees.
3. The app provides for a basket so that the user can select multiple people at one time without having to go through the same process recursively. 
4.  The app also provides for payment gateway so that the user doesn't have to deal with the hassle of negotiation and engaging with third party payments procedure. 
5.  The user also has the feature of deleting any of this selection from the Cart/Basket page if he/she reconsiders their decision. 

## Description of the codebase

The code is well arranged into sub-directories which are -
1. The first page is the ```home``` page. 
2. The second page is the ```product```catalogue page. 
3. The third page is the ``` Cart/Basket``` page. 
4. The fourth Page is the ```Connect With``` page so that the user can connect with prospective clients.
